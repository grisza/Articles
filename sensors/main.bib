abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel multi-sensor fusion method to build a human skeleton. We propose to fuse the joint position information obtained from the popular Kinect sensor with more precise estimation of body segment orientations provided by a small number of wearable inertial sensors. The use of inertial sensors can help to address many of the well known limitations of the Kinect sensor. The precise calculation of joint angles potentially allows the quantification of movement errors in technique training, thus facilitating the use of the low-cost Kinect sensor for accurate biomechanical purposes e.g. the improved human skeleton could be used in visual feedback-guided motor learning, for example. We compare our system to the gold standard Vicon optical motion capture system, proving that the fused skeleton achieves a very high level of accuracy.},

abstract = {Motion Analysis, Inertial Measurement Unit, IMU, Motion Tracking, Kinect, Data Fusion, Kalman Filter. This paper presents an approach for the tracking of limb movements using orientation information acquired from Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) and optical information from a Kinect sensor. A new algorithm that uses a Kalman filter to fuse the Kinect and IMU data is presented. By fusing optical and orientation information we are able to track the movement of limb joints precisely, and almost drift-free. First, the IMU data is processed using the gradient descent algorithm proposed in (Madgwick et al., 2011) which calculates the orientation information of the IMU using acceleration and velocity data. Measurements made with IMUs tend to drift over time, so in a second stage we compensate for the drift using absolute position information obtained from a Microsoft Kinect sensor. The fusion of sensor data also allows to compensate for faulty or missing measurements. We have carried out some initial experiments on arm tracking. The first results show that our technique for data fusion has the potential to be used to record common medical exercises for clinical movement analysis.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a method for body motion analysis in dance using multiple Kinect sensors. The proposed method applies fusion to combine the skeletal tracking data of multiple sensors in order to solve occlusion and self-occlusion tracking problems and increase the robustness of skeletal tracking. The fused skeletal data is split into five different body parts (torso, left hand, right hand, left leg and right leg), which are then transformed to allow view invariant posture recognition. For each part, a posture vocabulary is generated by performing k-means clustering on a large set of unlabeled postures. Finally, body part postures are combined into body posture sequences and Hidden Conditional Random Fields (HCRF) classifier is used to recognize motion patterns (e.g. dance figures). For the evaluation of the proposed method, Tsamiko dancers are captured using multiple Kinect sensors and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the high recognition accuracy of the proposed method.},

We investigate the possibilities of using multiple Kinects in the same en- vironment for capturing opaque and translucent objects in motion. Arising issues with the laser subsystems interfering with each other are solved using fast rotating disks, creating a time division multiple access (TDMA) sce- nario.

abstract = {This paper presents a sensor fusion approach to fusing Microsoft Kinect sensor and the built-in inertial sensors in a mobile device. A multi-rate Kalman filter is designed and applied for fusing the low-sampling-rate (30Hz) uncertain positions sensed by the Kinect sensor and the high-sampling-rate (90Hz) accelerations measured by the inertial sensors. These sensors have complementary properties. The Kinect can be applied for skeleton tracking, which gives the joints' positions. Meanwhile, the built-in inertial sensors in the mobile device sense the hand motion and the acceleration can be estimated through inertial sensor fusion. Firstly, convert the acceleration estimated with inertial sensors from the body frame into the Kinect coordinate system. Experimental results show that the hand accelerations estimated with the Kinect sensor and the inertial sensors are comparable. Secondly, design and apply a multi-rate Kalman filter for sensor fusion. The sensor fusion helps improve the accuracy of the system state estimation including the position, the velocity and the acceleration. This is of great benefit for combining inertial sensors and the external position sensing device for indoor augmented reality (AR) and other location-aware sensing applications.},

Then, we compare them regarding to several criteria: required equipment, light pattern coding, color analysis, texture analysis, motion analysis, security, use in non-controlled environment. The description is IRSL, ISL and FSL sensors will permit to sum up these techniques; the comparison will permit to evaluate performances and efficiency of each of them.

abstract = {This paper reports the first phase of a research program on visual perception of motion patterns characteristic of living organisms in locomotion. Such motion patterns in animals and men are termed here as biological motion. They are characterized by a far higher degree of complexity than the patterns of simple mechanical motions usually studied in our laboratories. In everyday perceptions, the visual information from biological motion and from the corresponding figurative contour patterns (the shape of the body) are intermingled. A method for studying information from the motion pattern per se without interference with the form aspect was devised. In short, the motion of the living body was represented by a few bright spots describing the motions of the main joints. It is found that 10--12 such elements in adequate motion combinations in proximal stimulus evoke a compelling impression of human walking, running, dancing, etc. The kinetic-geometric model for visual vector analysis originally developed in the study of perception of motion combinations of the mechanical type was applied to these biological motion patterns. The validity of this model in the present context was experimentally tested and the results turned out to be highly positive.},

abstract = {In recent months Kinect and Xtion sensors appear massively at the entertainment market. In parallel, many developers show engineering applications of the system related with their 3D imaging possibilities. In this work a metrological geometric verification of the systems is performed using a standard artifact which consists of five delrin spheres and seven aluminum cubes. Accuracy and precision tests show non-dependence with the type of sensor (two Kinect and one Xtion are used for the experiment) or with the incident angle between the standard artifact and the sensor (45°, 90° and 135°). Precision decreases with range according to a second order polynomial equation. Ranges larger than 7 m cannot provide any measurement. Accuracy data change from 5 mm to -15 mm for 1 m range and from 5 mm to -25 mm for 2 m range. Precision data change from 1 mm to 6 mm for 1 m range and from 4 mm to 14 mm for 2 m range. The results confirm that these sensors can be used in many engineering applications when the measurement range is short and accuracy requirements are not very strict. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.},

It is applicable to inertial measurement units (IMUs) consisting of tri-axis gyroscopes and accelerometers, and magnetic angular rate and gravity (MARG) sensor arrays that also include tri-axis magnetometers. The MARG implementation incorporates magnetic distortion compensation. The algorithm uses a quaternion representation, allowing accelerometer and magnetometer data to be used in an analytically derived and optimised gradient descent algorithm to compute the direction of the gyroscope measurement error as a quaternion derivative. Performance has been evaluated empirically using a commercially available orientation sensor and reference measurements of orientation obtained using an optical measurement system. Performance was also benchmarked against the propriety Kalman-based algorithm of orientation sensor. Results indicate the algorithm achieves levels of accuracy matching that of the Kalman based algorithm; {\&}{\#}x003C; 0.8{\&}{\#}x00B0; static RMS error, {\&}{\#}x003C; 1.7{\&}{\#}x00B0; dynamic RMS error. The implications of the low computational load and ability to operate at small sampling rates significantly reduces the hardware and power necessary for wearable inertial movement tracking, enabling the creation of lightweight, inexpensive systems capable of functioning for extended periods of time.},

@article{Armstrong1992,
abstract = {This study evaluated measures for making comparisons of errors across time series. We analyzed 90 annual and 101 quarterly economic time series. We judged error measures on reliability, construct validity, sensitivity to small changes, protection against outliers, and their relationship to decision making. The results lead us to recommend the Geometric Mean of the Relative Absolute Error (GMRAE) when the task involves calibrating a model for a set of time series. The GMRAE compares the absolute error of a given method to that from the random walk forecast. For selecting the most accurate methods, we recommend the Median RAE (MdRAE) when few series are available and the Median Absolute Percentage Error (MdAPE) otherwise. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is not reliable, and is therefore inappropriate for comparing accuracy across series. ?? 1992.},

abstract = {Accelerometers are sensitive to both linear acceleration and the local gravitational field. The former provides information on taps and other handset motions allowing the development of 'gesture' user interfaces while the latter provides information on the accelerometer orientation which allows a smartphone or tablet display to automatically switch between portrait and landscape settings. This application note documents the mathematics of orientation determination using a three-axis accelerometer. The techniques are applicable to both digital accelerometers and, after signal digitization, to analog accelerometers. For convenience, it is assumed that the accelerometer is mounted in a smartphone or tablet but the arguments apply to any product with an embedded three-axis accelerometer.},

abstract = {Accurate step counting is important in pedometer based indoor localization. Existing step detection techniques are not sufficiently accurate, especially at low walking speeds that are commonly observed when navigating unfamiliar environments. This is more critical when vision impaired indoor navigation is considered due to the fact that they have relatively low walking speeds. Almost all existing pedometer techniques use accelerom- eter data to identify steps, which is not very accurate at low walking speeds. This paper describes a gyroscope based pedometer algorithm implemented in a smartphone. The smartphone is placed in the pocket of the trouser, which is a usual carrying position of the mobile phone. The gyroscope sensor data is used for the identification of steps. The algorithm was designed to demand minimal computational resources so that it can be easily implemented in an embedded platform. Raw data from the sensor are filtered using a 6th order Butterworth filter for noise reduction. This is then sent though a zero crossing detector which identifies the steps. A minimum delay between two consecutive zero crossings was used to avoid fluctuations being counted and peak detection was used to validate steps. The algorithm has a calibration mode, in which the absolute minimum swing of data is learnt to set the threshold. This approach demonstrated accuracies above 96{\%} even at slow walking speeds on flat land, above 95{\%} when walking up/down hills and above 90{\%} when going up/down stairs. This has supported the concept that the gyroscope can be used efficiently in step identification for indoor positioning and navigation systems.},

@article{Wang2011,
	abstract = {Development of denoising algorithm for 3D acceleration signals is essential to facilitate accurate assessment of human movement in body sensor networks (BSN). In this study, firstly 3D acceleration signals were captured by self-developed nine-axis wireless BSN platform during 12 subjects performing regular walking. Then, acceleration noise was filtered using four common filters respectively: median filter, Butterworth low-pass filter, discrete wavelet package shrinkage and Kalman filter. Finally, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and correlation coefficient(R) between filtered signal and reference signal were determined. We found that (1) Kalman filter showed the largest SNR and R values, followed by median filter, discrete wavelet package shrinkage and finally Butterworth low-pass filter; whereas, after correcting waveform delay for Butterworth low-pass filter, its performance was a little better than that of Kalman filter; (2) Real-time performance of median filter related to its window length; Decomposition level influenced real-time performance of discrete wavelet package shrinkage; Butterworth low-pass filter could bring large waveform delay if filter order and cut-off frequency were not properly selected. The algorithms of these filters would be further investigated to achieve best noise reduction of 3D acceleration signals in future.},
